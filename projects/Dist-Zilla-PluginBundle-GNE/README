NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::GNE - Build the way we do at Genentech.

VERSION
    version 2.112940

DESCRIPTION
    This bundle is meant to do just about everything needed for building a
    GPAN distribution the way that we do at Genentech.

    It includes the following plugins, generally with their default
    configuration. Some plugins have specific attributes preset (documented
    below) and some can have particular attributes overridden as described.
    If you have to do something fancier, you'd better already know how to do
    it....

    By default the bundle releases using Subversion::ReleaseDist and
    Pinto::Add. You change that using the bundle's releaser argument, e.g.

      [@GNE]
      releaser = FakeRelease

    AutoVersion
        You can set Autoversion's major number by setting this bundle's
        autoversion_major parameter, e.g.

          [@GNE]
          autoversion_major = 42
